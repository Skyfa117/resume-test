# resume
**This repository is a static Github Pages hosted resume with a modern, monotone aesthetic with mobile device support.**

> [!note]
> **Current Issue(s):**
> - `html2pdf` is currently configured to resize the resume and print to A4 scaling. This is suboptimal.
>
> **Current Workaround(s):**
> - Take screenshots, use online [PNG2PDF converters](https://png2pdf.com/) followed by [PDF mergers](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf).
>   - (*Note: if using Adobe Acrobat Online, incognito windows may be required for fresh cookies*)

### Inspiration
- The original style stems from the [responsive-resume-cv-smith](https://github.com/bedimcode/responsive-resume-cv-smith)
repository, but modified and filled out to my liking for my personal resume.

### Forking
- I have made sure to comment and standardize the contents of `index.html` to allow for easy modification for anyone that
wants to ~~steal~~ *use* my resume template.


1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your own profile picture to `./assets/img/`.
3. Adjust `index.html` with your own data accordingly.
4. Enable page deployment: ``Repo --> Settings --> Pages --> Build and Deployment --> Deploy from a branch (main)``
5. Your resume should then be hosted at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo_name>`
